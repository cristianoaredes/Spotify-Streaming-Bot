### Please leave a star for the project. This project is free and open source. ‚≠ê You can leave a star from the top right. ‚≠ê‚≠ê.

This project is a Spotify listener bot. With this bot, it automatically logs into Spotify web and then opens the Spotify song link it asks you for, pressing the play button. The foundation of the project is Python Selenium.

The project reflects as a listener to you. The project is new and will be supported with updates, but my sole motivation is for you to give the project a star..

The program is new, still in development, please report any bugs to us on the discord server. ‚ö†Ô∏è

# üì• Installation & Usage

### - For the detailed installation pdf, which is the solution to all errors, come to my [discord server](https://discord.gg/AFV9m8UXuT)

- Python must be installed
- If your Python is not installed, download the latest version (3.11) of python and make sure to click on the 'ADD TO PATH' during installation.

- ### Install the chromedriver version compatible with the installed version of Google Chrome on your computer. ‚ö†Ô∏è

  https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/?pli=1
  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kichi779/Spotify-Streaming-Bot/ kichispotify

cd kichispotify

pip install -r requirements.txt (Or you can click on install.bat file)
```
## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

- **After completing the installation process, make sure that you have successfully installed the chromedriver.**

- Type mail:password line by line in the accounts.txt file.

- **Then run the run.bat file or double click the main.py file.**

- **If you are going to use a proxy, write n if not using y.**

- **Enter the Spotify song URL**

- **My advice to you is not to use the keyboard and mouse before all processes are finished. In some places, the program uses the escape key.**


# Usage recommendations üìñ

- This system opens multiple background sites, so make sure you have plenty of RAM or perform this operation on an unused computer. (It could be on a powerful virtual server.)

- Premium accounts give clearer results, new accounts may not generate income for you.

-I do not recommend changing the time sleep settings in the program, it is guaranteed to be slow, I tried to make it behave like a real person

# Detailed Analysis of Project Features

## Overview

This project is a Spotify listener bot that automates the process of logging into Spotify, opening a specified song link, and pressing the play button. The bot is built using Python and Selenium, and it aims to simulate human behavior to avoid detection by Spotify's anti-bot measures.

## Features

### 1. User Agent and Language Selection

The bot randomly selects a user agent and language from predefined lists to mimic different browsers and locales. This helps in avoiding detection by making the bot's requests appear as if they are coming from different users.

### 2. Proxy Usage

The bot has an option to use proxies, which can be specified in the `proxy.txt` file. This feature is currently not fully implemented and will be added after the project receives 50 stars.

### 3. Random Timezone and Geolocation

The bot sets a random timezone and fake geolocation for each session. This adds another layer of randomness to the bot's behavior, making it harder for Spotify to detect it as a bot.

### 4. Announcement and Update Check

The bot checks for updates and announcements from the project's GitHub repository. If a new version is available, it prompts the user to download the latest version. It also displays any announcements from the repository.

### 5. Multiple Account Support

The bot supports multiple Spotify accounts, which can be specified in the `accounts.txt` file. It logs into each account sequentially and starts playing the specified song.

## Usage Recommendations

- Use premium accounts for better results.
- Avoid using the keyboard and mouse while the bot is running.
- Ensure you have enough RAM or use a powerful virtual server to run the bot.

# Results of Deep Analysis and Recommendations

## Results

- The bot successfully logs into Spotify and starts playing the specified song.
- The random user agent, language selection, and fake geolocation features help in avoiding detection.
- The bot can handle multiple accounts and proxies (once fully implemented).

## Recommendations

- Implement the proxy feature fully to enhance the bot's effectiveness.
- Add error handling for different scenarios, such as failed logins or network issues.
- Optimize the bot's performance to reduce resource usage.
